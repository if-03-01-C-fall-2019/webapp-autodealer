# IF.03.01-03 Basic Web Techniques - Project Overview
This coding assignment shall make you practice all concepts we have learned so far. Make sure that you read the section *Required Tasks*  in [CodingAssignment.md](CodingAssignment.md) carefully and to complete all the tasks listed there.

Webapp:
This app will be an AutoGame, which shows you where to dodge cars and for every dodge you get a point and you build up a score
+You control a flying car that threatens to fall down every time, you have to hold the car in the air by pressing the space key to avoid obstacles
+The points are saved to buy new features
+But there is also a score table, where you can see which player is the best

Feature:
+A future is that you get double points to reach a higher score (you need 150 points to buy it)
+A 2 Future is that if you die you get a 2 chance (you need 200 points to buy it)

Obstacles:
+trucks
+cars
+Locks

Desgin:
+The background is a street
+The obstacles are all vertical and up or down by the road
+Trucks are there to do the higher and lower distances
+Cars are there to stay evenly in the middle to avoid them
+Blocks always come after a truck to go up or down immediately with a faster speed, otherwise you won't be able to avoid it
+The figure is a car with wings
