      <h2>Audi AI:RACE</h2>
      <img src="../img/audif.PNG" alt="">
      <p>High-performance sports car with electric drive: For the first time, Audi is presenting a<br>
        design and technical concept car at Pebble Beach Automotive Week in Monterey,<br>
        California. The all-electric Audi AI:RACE presents a radical vision for the high-<br>
        performance sports car of tomorrow. Broad and flat, visibly inspired by the wind tunnel<br>
        and the race track, its very presence signals that it is destined to push boundaries.</p>

              In the Audi AI:RACE, the driver is the one steering and stepping on the gas or brake pedal. There are therefore<br>
              no complex systems for piloted driving on board and no comfort features to add weight.<br>
              In their place are a driver’s seat and cockpit that are integrated into an inner monocoque shell that can be slid laterally. When<br>
              driven solo, the monocoque can be positioned in the center of the interior as in a monoposto – the perfect<br>
              location for the racetrack. This is made possible not least by the by-wire design of the steering and pedals;<br>
              a mechanical connection of the control elements is not needed.
