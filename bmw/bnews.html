      <h2>BMW Vision M NEXT</h2>
      <img src="../img/bmwf.jpg" alt="">
      <p>The design of the BMW Vision M NEXT is the result of an internal competition.<br>
        BMW designers competed against each other with their hand-drawn sketches and visualizations.<br>
        The best designs were selected over several rounds until in the end a design was chosen for implementation.<br>
        The process from the initial idea to the finished vision vehicle took around 18 months.<br>
        "This type of implementation only works if everyone involved has the same goal.<br>
        That's why I'm very proud of my team, which has worked intensively on the project over the past few months,"<br>
        says Domagoj Dukec, Head of BMW Design.</p>
