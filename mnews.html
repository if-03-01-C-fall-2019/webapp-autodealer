              The powerful, attention grabbing Mercedes-AMG Project ONE hypercar brings fully-fledged Formula 1 hybrid technology directly from the <br>
              ace track to the road. Celebrating 50 years of AMG, Mercedes-Benz provides another insight into the future.<br>
              <br>
              This lightning-fast, two-seater show car produces over 1,000 hp and reaches top speeds in excess of 200 mph. Featuring the same 1.6-litre <br>
              V6 hybrid petrol engine as the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula 1 race car, the Project ONE’s drive system also includes a total of four <br>
              electric motors, capable of a staggering 50,000 rpm. The combustion engine working in conjunction with the electric turbocharge means <br>
              that this show car obtains significantly more drive energy per litre of fuel.<br>
              <br>
              Meanwhile, technologies such as all-wheel drive, an automated 8-speed manual transmission, and a high-performance carbon ceramic <br>
              braking system ensure dynamic handling and an exhilarating driving experience.<br>
              <br>
              Inside, the cockpit has a stripped-back, functional aesthetic that underlines its motorsport pedigree. <br>
              Every part has a specific purpose, from the two free-standing 10-inch displays to the contoured bucket seats, finished in slip-resistant <br>
              black microfibre and nappa leather, with a sporty textile mesh to optimise air circulation.<br>
              <br>
              The expressive, eye-catching exterior embodies the Mercedes-AMG principle that fascination is always linked with function. The distinctive <br>
              air inlets, powerful spoiler, large tailpipes, and F1-style air intake integrated into the roofline make Project ONE the ultimate driving <br>
              machine.

            The development of the Mercedes-AMG Project ONE show car, has been intensively worked on behind closed doors for several months. In <br>
            a highly complex, digital development process ("Project ONE Virtual Engineering"), the transnational project team worked towards its <br>
            common goal: putting Formula 1 hybrid technology on the road.<br>
            <br>
            Hundreds of testing hours have already been spent to master the immense challenge of making the high-performance drive unit ready for <br>
            series production: the whole powertrain including all hybrid components underwent the toughest race track tests on the <br>
            high-performance dyno tests of HPP's engine specialists in Brixworth.<br>
            <br>
            The successful completion of the dyno tests was followed by the installation of the highly complex powertrain into the first prototypes, <br>
            which since then has been driving around unnoticed on a secret test ground in England. But today it turns out to be more difficult to keep <br>
            this testing confidential: the camouflaged prototypes of the Mercedes-AMG hypercar are still being driven on closed off test grounds and <br>
            acetracks. However, because of their specific and very characteristic F1 sound they are hard to keep from the public. See below some of <br>
            the latest imagery of impressive Mercedes-AMG Project ONE prototype.<br>
